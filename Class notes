# Notes from 2.12.2021:

we don't use the quantile $F^{-1}$ because to compute for the tail of the distribution is not good 

peaks-over-threshold we take values high enough to show the extremes -> number of exceedences arise according to a Poisson distribution with lambda parameter (probability of getting an exceedence)

to find mu we can use the plot method not perfect answer though we take the quantile and keep what is over the quantile 
alpha is the risk level that we want to take 

ES: expected shortfall

practical 2: back testing

data -> $x_1, .., x_n$ -> cross validation for the risk measure -> split data set in two (training set and test set) -> backtesting on training test -> use a window on 150 days for the value at risk everyday -> estimation of ? value at risk -> every day for each value at risk at level alpha there is a probaility p = 1-p that my value at risk is exceeded -> value at risk has a very small probability 1 - alpha that it is exceeded -> distribution is 0 (not violated) or 1 (if violated) is the bernouilli distribution : if x > value at risk at value alpha, = 1 with prob p = 1- alpha and = 0 otherwise with p = alpha -> everyday we have an indicator that follows a bernouilli distribution if the model/value at risk is correct -> if 500 value at risk every day for 500 days: the sum of independent bernouillis is a binomial distirbution (repeats independent bernuoilli experiments) where n= 500 and p = 0.5 -> intuitively: 500 days for each day we have a value at risk at alpha 0.95% -> how many times can i expect a value to be over the value at risk: 500*0.05 = 25 times -> we can expect that in 25 times we have a vioation of the value at risk = value that canbe exceeded once time in probability 0.05 (n is n' in the slides ) => on R: estimate value at risk every day with moving window of historical data, each day we compare with the data we have (crossvalidation), if validated = 1 otherwise 0, binomial test => compare the expected number of violation with the ones we got => best way to assess the value at risk 

the normal distribution would ten dto underestmate the value at risk/risk we we'd compare our value at risk with the quantile of the normal distribution !
